The application made is inspired from the A* path finding algorithm video by "TechWithTim".

**Improvements made:** Checking the diagonal neighbouring blocks as well (considering the distance 1.414), to also avail the diagonal paths besides the stepped paths. Moreover, a restart button and a different heuristic mode have been added, including an optimer way with heapq-s.

Here is a small clip of the pygame app built.
